# Random-Forests
Random Forest is a supervised learning algorithm

Random forest builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction

Random Forest is an extension of bagging that in addition to building trees based on multiple samples of your training data, it also constrains the features that can be used to build the trees,forcing trees to be different. 
This, in turn, can give a lift in performance
